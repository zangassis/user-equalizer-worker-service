A Worker Service project created as an example for the article I produced for the [Telerik Blog](telerik.com/blogs).

## Technologies used in this project:

- EF Core
- SQLite
- Fake API by [JsonPlaceHolder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

To run this project locally you need to have the .NET 6 SDK installed.
